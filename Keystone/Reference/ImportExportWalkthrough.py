    "\n"+
    "Let's talk about importing and exporting binds!",

    "First walkthrough we edited your battle cry to add some awesome.\n" +
    "Now maybe you added some cool emotes you want to use on every character.\n" +
    "We can save it in an export file and then import it into other files.\n" +
    "Let's export yours just to see how it works.\n"+
    "\n"+
    "First open the keybinds file we made in the Intro Walkthrough.\n"
    "\n"+
    "Got it?  Great!  Now go to the Import Export menu and select Export Binds",

    "Things changed.\n"+
    "We got check boxes next to every command.\n"+
    "You can select or deselect everything from the top\n"+
    "\n"+
    "Where we used to have a Save button we now can Select or Cancel.\n"+
    "\n"+

    "\n" +
    "Okay no, but that kst is for Keystone.  I'm a file extension!\n" +
    "Techy folk might notice its a json file, but don't start calling me Jason.\n"+

    "Save the file where you can find it then we can import it back to see that.",

    "Back?  Hit where it says New(Defaults) just to make something we can import into.\n\n" +
    "Now got to Import Export again and select Import Binds this time.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Since we haven't saved this file it will ask if you want to, you can say no.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "You will get another exciting file dialog you can use to select the file you created.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Then something more interesting will happen.",

    "Since we have a battle cry emote on the F10 default, it's warning us before its lost.\n" +
    "You could click Ok and it would overwrite, but let's Cancel to see what happens then.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "There's the New Bind dialog just like if we clicked the New Bind button.\n" +
    "This gives you a chance to change the keys, or see more closely what it does.\n" +
    "If you Cancel AGAIN it will give up.  If you Ok it will add the new bind.\n" +
    "Anything that was added will be marked in the list just like you edited it.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Simple right?\n" + 
    "\n" +
    "We exported some cool stuff that fell of the back of a public forum.  You want to see?",

    "Back on the Import Export menu click Predefined Binds...\n" +

    "use_inspirations.kst is one of my favorites.  Lets me just tap F3 and F4 like mad\n" +
    "when someone is 'arresting' me for loitering with a key they happen to need.\n" +
    "Click on ...more... to see more about what it does.\n" +
    "Clicking the Import button is just like using Import Binds to import the file."
